# Artificial Intelligence — Eye Image Classification

This repository contains a single Jupyter notebook implementing a **gender classification** experiment from **eye images**, plus the accompanying course report.

## Contents
- `Project.ipynb` — end-to-end notebook: data loading/preprocessing, model definition and training, and evaluation/visualization.
- `CPE451 Report` — project write-up with background, method, and results.

## Highlights
- Computer vision pipeline on eye crops (preprocessing, normalization, basic augmentation).
- Convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Python with common ML libraries.
- Clear separation of training vs. evaluation inside the notebook, with plotted learning curves and sample predictions.

## Notes
This repo is intended as a **self-contained coursework project** and reference for future experimentation.
